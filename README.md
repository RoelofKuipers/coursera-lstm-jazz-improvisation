# coursera-lstm-jazz-improvisation
Notebook for the exercise 'Jazz Improvisation with LSTM' for the 'Sequence Models' course for the Coursera 'Deeplearning.ai' specialization

Please find the beautiful jazz improvisation I created as a wav file in the output folder.

To do: recreate this project myself using Tensorflow.
